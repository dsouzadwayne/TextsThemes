# TextsThemes
Custom themes for the Texts app.



I've used AI to create a purple-dark theme for the Texts app. I am not much of a coder, so if there are bugs, I do sincerely apologise.
There are two versions; one is for a minimalist-styled theme; you won't be able to see timestamps, social media network icons or profile pictures, just plain chat.
The other version just changes the theme.
